Structure:

- Make a directory (folder) for each question, named like `u01-mc-history`
  - `u` means "unit"
  - `01` means "unit 1" (two digits, so they sort correctly)
  - `mc` means "multiple choice". Other types include `sa` (short answer), `tf` (true/false), or other.
- In each directory, make a `README.md` file that contains the question.
- In each directory, make an `answer.md` file that contains the answer, and an explanation of why the answer is correct.
- In each directory, make a `SLO.md` that contains the learning objective(s) that the question is testing. You can generally copy and paste these from the unit's Objectives section on the website.
