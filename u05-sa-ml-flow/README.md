Below are some steps in training a machine learning model. How would you order them in their proper order?

1. Compute the loss
2. Do a forward pass through the model (compute the predictions)Tweak the weight parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient
3. Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights
4. Initialize the parameters of the model
5. Do a forward pass through the model (compute the predictions)
